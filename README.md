# Employee Database with SQL
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to assist the manager of Pewlett Hackard to prepare for the upcoming "silver tsunami" of retirees at the company. In an effort to avoid a disastrous employee deficit, we are creating a report to address the following questions: 
1. Which employees will be retiring in the next few years at Pewlett Hackard?
2. How many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill?
3. Which employees will be eligible for the retirement package (the mentorship role)?

## Results
### Employees Eligible for Retirement

[Eligible Employees per Title](https://github.com/jpb12002/Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis/blob/main/Data/retiring_titles.csv)

- There are approximately 90,400 employees who will soon be eligible for retirment. This is almost one-third of the approximately 300,000 current employees, which represents a massive personnel loss for the company.
- The positions with the highest risk for employee loss are "senior engineers" (29,414 employees retirement eligible) and "senior staff" (28,254 employees retirement eligible). These are high-ranking positions that represent a lot of experience in their respective fields. Pewlett Hackard will have to spend a signficant amount of time and resources to find replacements for these employees. On the other hand, this creates opportunity for many entry-level employees to be promoted within the company. 
- 2 department managers will be eligible for retirement. These executive roles are crucial to ensuring different departments run seemlessly and will require extensive time and resources to replace.
